Magic 8-Ball

The Magic 8-Ball is a popular toy developed in the 1950s for fortune-telling or advice seeking.

Write a magic8.py Python program that can answer any “Yes” or “No” question with a different fortune each time it executes.

We’ll be using the following 9 possible answers for our Magic 8-Ball:

Yes - definitely
It is decidedly so
Without a doubt
Reply hazy, try again
Ask again later
Better not tell you now
My sources say no
Outlook not so good
Very doubtful
